# Hybrid-Teacher

## This is the repo for our work of a Hybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) for semi-supervised segmentation of MRI scans. Our code is under active refactoring at the moment and is scheduled to release in a few months. If you are eager to learn about our project please reach out to me at jiayi.zhu3@unsw.edu.au.
