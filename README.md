# Hybrid-Teacher

### This is the repo for our work of a Hybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) for semi-supervised segmentation of MRI scans. Our code is under active refactoring and is scheduled to be released upon acceptance of our paper (I'm also very busy with job searching atm). If you are eager to learn about our project please reach out to me at jiayi.zhu3@unsw.edu.au.
