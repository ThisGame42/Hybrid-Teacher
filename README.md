# Hybrid-Teacher

### This is the repo for our work of a Hybrid Dual Mean-Teacher (HD-Teacher) network for semi-supervised segmentation of MRI scans. Our code is under active refactoring (I'm a bit busy with job searching atm). If you are eager to learn about our project please reach out to me at jiayi.zhu3@unsw.edu.au.
